# 🎬 Tikera Cinema – Frontend

A simple React-based cinema web app that lets users browse movie screenings and make seat reservations. 
There is no backend – all data is managed client-side. All reservations are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`.
The app is intended as an educational project.
